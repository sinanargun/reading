Readlist For My Own Craftman World! You know it will take time to get better. Don't quit practising and always strive with

Some Notes:
  A confusing abundance of metaphors has grown up around software development.
  David Gries says writing software is a science (1981). Donald Knuth says it\'s an art(1998).
  Watts Humphrey says it\'s a process (1989). P.J. Plauger and Kent Beck say it\'s like driving a car, 
  although they draw nearly opposite conclusions (Plauger 1993, Beck 2000). Alistair CockBurn says it\'s a game (2002).
  Eric Raymond says it\'s like a bazaar (2000). Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas say it\'s like gardening. Paul Heckel says 
  it\'s like filming Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1994). Fred Brooks says that it\'s like farming, hunting werewolves,
  or drowning with dinosaurs in a tar pit (1995).
